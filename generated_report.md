### Work Performed During September 2024  
**Financial Services Support**  

#### Eddy Biniam
- Assisted a colleague in gathering necessary 3 DAI reports and 1 Maximo report in order to send out a Cost Transfer in a timely fashion.
- Completed a hot item that my Supervisor and lead needed immediately. Did a contract PR’s for a CMTSS contract for goods. I was able to demonstrate the ability to remain calm and focused under pressure and submit the document without any mistakes so the document can be signed as soon as possible. I stayed until the task was completed and supervisor was informed. 
- Worked on looking the Status of Funds for FY22 as well as FY23 and verify that there was no funds remaining. Upon accessing DAI and gathering the data, not only did I communicate with my supervisor my findings but I edit the Status of Funds data so my supervisor can see and read the information gather in a manner that is easy to read. 
- Completed 2 contract PRs for goods for 20K. I was able to provide a solution to my supervisor. One of my colleagues who was in charge or creating those PRs continued to get an error message. I was able to create 2 PRs with my supervisor looking on correctly in order to see if they can see it in PD2. Which the creation of the PR’s was a success and was able to be seen in PD2. Since it is the close of the FY we could not afford to delay due to in-corrections. The corrections was able to be made and not delay the process. 
- Worked on assisting my supervisor on looking for a specific MIPR that was on the Open Commitment Pivot Tables I pull and create every morning. I was provided the correct email chain and cc’d the correct emails so the agency (DLA) could be provided with the correct MIPR that they were requesting. It was of up most importance for the agency to receive that MIPR so we can receive and process the 448-2 acceptance with urgency.
